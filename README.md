# Milestone-Project-1
The first milestone project I undertook during my [Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/) on Udemy.

### Programming language and IDE:
This project was done in Python on Jupyter Notebook

### Project Description
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game between two human players.

The markdown within the Jupyter Notebook are Walkthrough Steps provided by the Bootcamp. As this was my first big project, I followed the steps to finish it.
